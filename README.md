# R-PJS-Scrape

This repo gathers a few files I wrote to hack out the Kayak website in order to gather data to help me choose the cheapest flight tickets to go back to France.

It uses a combibation of PhabtomJS to get the page and R to parse and store the results. The data is then surfaced through a Shiny app (to come!).

It might be more inspirational than reusable as is :-).
